             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 07
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is

COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.

             WAGES - HOURLY RATE OF PAY FOR JOB 10
 
The hourly rate of pay as of either the job's stop date or the interview date 
for on-going jobs. If the job lasted 13 weeks or less this variable is

COMMENT: although this calculation - which factors in the reported pay, rate of 
pay time unit, and hours worked - can produce extremely low or extremely high 
pay rates, these values are not edited.
